<h1 align="center">Self-Driving Cars Specialization
</h1>



This Specialization gives a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art engineering practices used in the self-driving car industry. You'll get to interact with real data sets from an autonomous vehicle (AV)―all through hands-on projects using the open source simulator CARLA.

Throughout the courses, you’ll hear from industry experts who work at companies like Oxbotica and Zoox as they share insights about autonomous technology and how that is powering job growth within the field.

You’ll learn from a highly realistic driving environment that features 3D pedestrian modelling and environmental conditions. When you complete the Specialization successfully, you’ll be able to build your own self-driving software stack and be ready to apply for jobs in the autonomous vehicle industry.

## There are 4 Courses in this Specialization

1) Introduction to Self-Driving Cars
2) State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars
3) Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars
4) Motion Planning for Self-Driving Cars
