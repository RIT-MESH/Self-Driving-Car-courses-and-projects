----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Assigment 0:
-> Python Intro (classes, dict, numpy)
### Assigment 1:
-> BFS and DFS algorithms
### Assigment 2:
-> A* implemented on simple grid world, with simple counting distance to goal location as heuristic function
### Assigment 3:
-> A* algorithm same as in previous assignment, but applied to New York map
### Assigment 4:
-> Advanced A* algorithm focused on having admissible and consistent heuristic, so it will find the most optimal way to goal.
