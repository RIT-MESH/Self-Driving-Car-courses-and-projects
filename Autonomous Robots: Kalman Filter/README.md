### Autonomous Robots Are The Future. Learn to Program Them With this Fast, Easy to Understand Course!

For lovers of cars, technology and robotics alike, this online course can teach you how to write the software needed to make a self-driving car work.

Regardless of your experience in coding, by the end of this course you will not only be proficient with Kalman Filters, but you’ll have an understanding of how robotics software works and how to write code in Python.

If you are already a coding expert, this in-depth look at how Kalman Filters function will help you diversify your robotics arsenal and level up your confidence in working with autonomous robots.

But this course isn’t just about accumulating knowledge. What sets this apart from other online robotics programs is that it make the process fun. You get to see what the real-life results of your code would look like with a simulated self-driving car. Robotics can (and should) be a field full of exploration, experimentation, fun, and getting your hands dirty.
